## Notes
* **Approximate reasoning**
	* Construct the *knowledge from the experts*
	* There are more *explainable models of AI*
	* Now always everything is true of false, it is *in the middle* (*approximate*)
	* Approximate reasoning deals with *uncertainty* and *imprecision*
	* *Example:* Temperature is above 20ºC
		* Temperature is 25ºC  ---> *Precise* and *uncertain*
		* Temperature is higher than 15ºC -----> *Imprecise* and *certain*
	* *Reasoning with rules*
		* Given a *set of rules* --> new evidences is computed from the rules
		* *Rules: evidences--->conclusion*
	* *Models*
		* *Probabilistic approach*
		* *Quasi-probabilistic methods:* Certainty Factors
		* *Possibilistic approach:* Fuzzy Logic
		* *Existentian approach:* Dempster-Shafer Theory

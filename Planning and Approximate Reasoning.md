URV has several research groups working on AI. The lecturers of this course belong to the group ITAKA, which is organized into two laboratories. Web: [https://deim.urv.cat/~itaka/](https://deim.urv.cat/~itaka/)

- Data Analysis and Decision Support
- Computer Vision and Robotics

If you want to work on the AI field, it may be interesting for you to know the Catalan community. We have an association that is member of EurAI (the European federation of associations on AI). You can become a member for a year at a very cheap price. Many advantages are availble for you:

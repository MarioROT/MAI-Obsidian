## Notes
- Trends in computer science
	- *Ubiquity*: reduction in size and cost of computing capability
	- Interconnection devices today are networked into large distributed systems.
	- *Intelligence*: increase of the knowledge domain and inference capabilities to provide better user experiences.
	- *Delegation*: computers doing more for us without our intervention. (Giving control to computers)
	- *Human-orientation in programming methodologies*: Implement concepts and metaphors to reflect the way we understand the world.
- Programming progress

- **Goal?** --> a intelligent computer system that can act on our behalf
	- *Independently*
	- In a way that *represents our* best *interests*
	- Interconnection and distribution to *cooperate*, *reach agreements* or *compete*
- **Agent**
	- *Computer system* able to *interact independently* in a *dynamic environment*.
	- Assumed to be *autonomous*, *synchronize* and *coordinate* their activities at run time.
	- **Agent technologies**
		- *Agent-level*: refer to the individuals
		- *Interaction-level*: communication between agents
		- *Organization-level*: agent societies (structure, trust, norms, obligations, etc.)
	- *Systems taking the initiative when necessary*
	- Agents *cooperating to solve a task*
	- Take into account *social aspects*, these are important part of *intelligent activity in real-world*-settings.
	- **Agents vs Objects**
		- *Object*
			- Encapsulates some state, 
			- Communicates via message passing 
			- Has methods (operations to be performed on a given state)
			- *A method is always executed when called*.
		- *Agent*
			- Notion of autonomy (*decides whether to act or not on request from another agent*)
			- Intelligent
			- Flexible
			- Reactive
			- *Proactive*
			- Social
	- **Considerations**
		- Balance *reaction-deliberation*
		- *Learning* from an about other agents in the environment
		- Electing upon user *preferences*
		- Find ways to *negotiate* and *cooperate (coalitions)*
		- Agents are no expert systems, but sometimes somo expert systems are agntified.
	- **Some uses**
		- Complex and dynamic real-world environments simulations
		- A tool to get some light in the understanding  on various kinds of social processes.
		- *Agent-oriented software engineering* allows to structure applications with autonomous components.
- **Multi-agent system**
	- X number of agents interacting with each other. usually, each has a different goal and motivation.
	- *Cooperate*
	- *Negotiate*
	- *Coordinate*

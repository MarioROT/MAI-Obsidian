- Why to study ML?
	- Reduce human effort on complex or expensive tasks (*knowledge engineering bottleneck*)
	- Automatize processes and adapt them to multiple cases (*personalization*)
	- Discover new knowledge from large databases (*data mining*)
- A lot of data is exploited from social media users
- Already we have
	- Efficient algorithms
	- Large amounts of on-line data
	- Powerful computational resources
- *Arthur Samuel (1959)* ML allows computers to learn without explicit programmed instructions.

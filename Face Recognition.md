## Notes
* *How to define facial features?*
	* Eigenfaces
	* Linear discriminant analysis
* Feature extraction:
	* Is different to dimensional reduction, in the way that instead to create new features from data, you select important features.
* *Linear approaches*:
	* PCA: 
	* *Eigenfaces for face recognition*
	* *Linear discriminnt Analysis*

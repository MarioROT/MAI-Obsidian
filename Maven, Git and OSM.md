## Notes
- *Maven:* java tool to
	- Managing dependencies
	- Compiling source code
	- Packaging the code into deployable artifacts
	- Executing artifacts
	- It works describing settings in a XML file, you can configure
		- Repositores
		- Dependencies
		- Build
		- Profiles: to define build configs
		- Etc
	- Goals:
		- Provide a life-cycle consisting on several phases
			- Each *phase* is a sequence of goals, and each goal is *responsible* for a specific task.
		- *Useful goals (commands)*
			- *Clean*: `mvn clean`
			- *Build*: `mvn install`
			- *Run profile:*  `mvn -P profile-name exec:java`
		- Everytime the code is modified the project must be build using `mvn install`
- *Teamwork:* use Git to *document all changes* on the practical work code, you can use *Github*, *Gitlab*, or *Bitbucket*. Teacher must have read-only access to the repository.
- *OpenStreetMaps (OSM)*
	- A tool to extract maps, we need one for the project.
	- Link to download a map: https://overpass-turbo.eu/

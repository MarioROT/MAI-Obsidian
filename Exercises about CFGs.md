## Notes
- The difference between the last two trees, in the first the part of *with ears* is affecting to the *stars* noun and that is the one which gets the highest probability, unfortunately, because for us it doesn't make sense a *stars with ears*. In the second tree the part of *with ears* affects the noun *astronomers* with makes more sense, even though its tree gets a lower probability.
